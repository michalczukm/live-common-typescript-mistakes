This repository contains code from webinar about common TypeScript mistakes.

## Content

### Source

All examples can be found in files:

- [playground/play.ts](./playground/play.ts)
- [playground/types/my-types.d.ts](./playground/types/my-types.d.ts)

### Dist

Distrubution (not versioned) is in `playground/dist` directory.

It is worth to take a look what `.js` code is generated from our `.ts` files.

## How to run it

Code you can play with is in `playground` dir.

1. Go to playground `cd playground`
1. Install dependencies `npm ci`
1. Run it
   - to have `tsc` with `nodemon` in watch mode - run `npm start`
   - to only compile sources, and do it once - run `npm run compile`
